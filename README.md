# JJ Scraper

A web scraper for JJ's website that tracks product changes and generates comparison reports.

## Features

- Scrapes product data from JJ's website
- Stores data in Firebase Firestore
- Generates comparison reports showing:
  - New products
  - Removed products
  - Out-of-stock products
  - Price changes (increases/decreases)

## Development Approach

### 1. Scraping Strategy
- Used Scrapy framework for efficient web scraping
- Implemented dynamic pagination handling to navigate through all product pages
- Added robust error handling and logging for debugging
- Used CSS selectors for reliable data extraction
- Implemented rate limiting to avoid overwhelming the server

### 2. Data Storage
- Chose Firebase Firestore for:
  - Real-time data synchronization
  - Scalable document-based storage
  - Easy querying and filtering
  - Built-in timestamp support
- Implemented batch processing for efficient data updates
- Created separate collections for:
  - Products (current state)
  - Price history (tracking changes)
  - Stock history (tracking availability)
  - Reports (comparison results)

### 3. Comparison Logic
- Implemented a two-phase comparison:
  1. Get existing data from Firestore
  2. Run scraper to get current website data
  3. Compare both datasets to identify:
     - New products (in current but not in existing)
     - Removed products (in existing but not in current)
     - Price changes (comparing formatted prices)
     - Stock status changes (tracking availability)
- Used set operations for efficient comparison
- Implemented proper price formatting to handle currency symbols and commas

### 4. Report Generation
- Created a structured report format with:
  - Summary counts for each type of change
  - Detailed lists of affected product IDs
  - Timestamp for tracking when the comparison was made
- Stored reports in Firestore for historical tracking
- Implemented console output for immediate visibility

## Setup

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Set up Firebase:
   - Create a Firebase project
   - Download your service account credentials
   - Save as `firebase-credentials.json` in the project root

## Usage

python compare_and_report.py
```

The report will show:
- Total products scraped
- New products with their IDs
- Removed products with their IDs
- Out-of-stock products with their IDs
- Products with price increases/decreases
